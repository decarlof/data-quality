Please make sure the installation :ref:`pre-requisite-reference-label` are met.

This script is specific for beamline 32id.

This example takes two mandatory parameters:
instrument: a string defining the detector that will be used. User can enter one of these choices: 
'32id_nano', '32id_micro'. The instrument determines the directory to look for a configuration file that will be used.
file: a file to be verified for dependencies according to schema.

This script calls quality_check verifier.
